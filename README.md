## **Regarding tests**

- As you can see, I haven't written any tests for the features and fixes I added. I want to be genuine about it as it's been a long time since I wrote the tests and storybook components for the last time (~2 years). So, it will be inappropriate for me to ask for help from AI tools or anyone else. For that reason, I have skipped the tests.
